\title{Second derivative of the likelihood}
\usage{
D2(d1, d2, inv.Q, Alpha.Q)
}
\arguments{
\item{d1}{First derivative of the kernel function with respect to the required
hyper-parameter.}

\item{d2}{Second derivative of the kernel function with respect to the
required hyper-parameter.}

\item{inv.Q}{Inverse matrix of the covariance matrix}

\item{Alpha.Q}{This is iQY %*% t(iQY)-iQ, where iQ is the inverse of the
covariance matrix, Y is the response.}
}
\value{
A number
}
\description{
Calculates the second derivative of the likelihood function with respect to
one of the hyperparameters, given the first and second derivative of the
kernel with respect to that hyperparameter.
}
\details{
The function is to calculate the second derivative of the normal
 likelihood, using the first and second derivative of the kernel functions.
 The first and second derivative need to be pre-defined, for example of
 customized covariance function, see "demo('co2')".
