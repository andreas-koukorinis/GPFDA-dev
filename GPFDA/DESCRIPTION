Description:  The package provides functions for modelling functional data with 
    multidimensional inputs, multivariate functional data, and nonseparable 
    and/or nonstationary covariance structure of function-valued processes. 
    In addition, the package deals with functional regression models where 
    the mean function depends on scalar and/or functional covariates and 
    the covariance structure depends on functional covariates.
