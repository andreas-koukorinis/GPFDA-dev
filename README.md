# GPFDA-dev
Develop version of the package GPFDA

## Short history of the package
The package is initially to implement the model proposed by Shi, J. Q., et al. "Mixed‐effects Gaussian process functional regression models with application to dose–response curve prediction." Statistics in medicine 31.26 (2012): 3165-3177. (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.4502)

The early stage of the functions was in Matlab. Later Yafeng Cheng developed an R version and published on CRAN. The corresponding user manual with theoretical details and examples is available at https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/j.q.shi/ps/gpfda.pdf.

From 06/2019, Evandro Konzen joins the project. He brings non-stationary kernels and efficient computation to the package.
